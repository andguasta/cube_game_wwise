-- Installation ----------------------------------------------
Extract all files into the folder   packages/pigcam/  within your CUBE folder.  It is important that it goes in this specific folder or the campaign will not work as it should!
To play: open console using tilde (~) key. Type sp pigcam/pig01 and enter.

--MAP NOTES---------------------------------------------------
1: Because this is a campaign instead of a single level the objective in each level is no longer to kill every single enemy you encounter(although you'll often find this the easiest way of accomplishing your goal) instead you must get to the exit, unfourtunatly a carrot just like all the triggers, however it should be fairly obvious when you do find the finish.

2: Due to the way the cube engine works at the moment your ammo, health and armor will be reset at the end of each level.  Dont worry i've designed the levels with this in mind so you shouldn't have a problem.

3:  there are 1 or 2 puzzles in this campaign, if you seem to be stuck or unable to get past a certain section, try thinking through your options and attack things from a diffrent angle.

4: These 9 levels are generally easier than the other cube levels floating around, this is because their seems to be too many difficult levels flooding the cube community.  However this may mean you need to bump the difficulty up to make it more intresting to play.  Also if the early levels seem much to easy, keep on playing they DO get harder.

5: I LOVE feedback, and im always glad of it, even when its pretty scathing (as long as theres a good reason).  Please do send any comments, suggestions, questions and requests to me at jonathan@thewhitings.freeserve.co.uk

Test system: 1 Gig Procceser, Ge-Force 2, 1280x1024,
But you should get away with much, much less :D

--CUBE NOTES-------
Swimming: you can't drown; pump jump key to continue swimming up.
Gameplay: cube singleplayer has quite a diffrent feel to it than most modern games, this means it might take a little getting used too.  Remember that your harder to hit when your moving, and that the monsters aren't adverse to fighting among themselves and you should do okay.
