the core (part one - enter) by DCP cube.dietmarpier.de

skill level: cube expert

my first single player level ever... with lots of buttons, traps, secrets... you'll have to move a lot back and forth through the level and keep an eye on the text displays and listen to the mainframes messages which will often give you a hint what door the button you just pressed has opened and where this door was... the level design is a mixture of hexen/quake style so dont expect linear gameplay...

unzip to the cube root directory with full pathnames. this will place all data where it belongs...

new stuff:

- new skybox (*cube*/packages/dcp_the_core)
- new water texture (*cube*/packages/dcp_the_core)
- 1 game soundtrack (*cube*/packages/dcp_the_core)
- included are all new DCP models (though most of them aren't used in this map you get the full package) (*cube*/packages/models/dcp)
- some new game sounds (*cube/packages/sounds/dcp_the_core)

not included is the new trigger button model. i strongly advise you to download it from my cube stuff page and use the new one (make sure to backup the old model if you want to revert to this one later) because the level was designed using the new button model which fits much better! i didn't even check the level with the old model because i dont use it anymore.

all included data is designed for the cube game engine. any other use or any form of redistribution requires my permission.

to play change to game mode -2 (classic singelplayer) and type /map dcp_the_core/enter

have fun.
