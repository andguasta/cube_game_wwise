Description:

A very large single player map (about 800 monsters, about an hour of gameplay) for CUBE, release version 05-22-04.
Lots of environments to explore and be killed in. If you find the map too easy just set a higher skill level.
This is my fifth map for CUBE. Any feedback on this map would be great. Contact: mitaman1@optonline.net
Build time to create this single player map was FAR TOO MANY HOURS over SEVERAL MONTHS!!
================================================================
PERFORMANCE NOTES!!

People with low end computers may have trouble running this map.
(low frame rates due to large open areas and detailed mapping).

If you have trouble (low frame rates) running this map try the following:

Set game to 800x600 or 640x480 resolution (edit the cube.bat).

Turn off all texture filtering for your video card (look in video card properties: ansiotropic, anti-aliasing, etc...).

Set computer desktop color depth to 16 bit mode. (this can be a big help in frame rates).

Turn off any applications running in the background (firewall, anti-virus, etc...).

If this still doesn't help, sorry, you need a better computer/video card.
================================================================
This Map was play tested on the following machines:

Pentium 4: 2.5mhz / 512mb Ram / ATI 9600XT 128mb Video / WinXP / 1024x768 resolution / 32 bit color depth.
Map runs 60 fps with v'sync enabled.

Celeron: 500mhz / 256mb Ram / GeForce 2mx 32mb Video / WinME / 800x600 resolution / 16 bit color depth.
Map runs 25-35 fps with v'sync enabled.

**Special thanks to Makke and Spentron for their “map editing aid” on the forum.**


And of course to all others that have added materials/help suggestions to this great game.

The Cube community ROCKS! 
================================================================
Installation:

Extract the "mpsp5.zip" file into your CUBE folder. (example: C:\cube)
This will create a "mpsp5" folder (with new textures) in the "packages" folder and place the map and config file in the "base" folder. It is important to extract the files into the CUBE folder (not the "packages" folder) or the map will not work as it should!

To play map:

open the console using tilde (~) key. Type "sp mpsp5" (without quotes) and press enter.

Gameplay hints: I suggest that when you teleport into a new area gather up supplies and save before moving on. Also, don't just blindly run into an area without checking out your surroundings, you will trigger more than you can handle if your not careful. This is a very large map with many areas to explore.
