"Castle Rampage"
Modified versions by Bill Spencer 3/30/04 (revised 5/28/04)

Maps:
rampage -- main map, 124 monsters vs. the original's 29. Added resources. New triggers
 bring forth more monsters; kill all to finish.
rampage_min -- Minimal change, 7 more monsters make the beginning more challenging,
 which extends tension into the level as the player recovers.
[rampage_hd --  I've decided to drop this version due to problems making all the
 134 monsters appear.]

Unzip the desired files into cube/packages/base folder. The included rampage.cfg file
plays my music pick from the current sountrack on the main version.

To play, run cube, then in the game press the tilde key (~), and type after the slash:
sp rampage  (or rampage_min). Note, all these levels
use Geometry-Controlled Creature Insertion Devices (GCCIDs ;) ) aka "monster machines", 
so pressing edit anytime during the game will make it impossible to kill all the monsters
(and finish the full version) -- if this happens, press edit again to return to game mode,
and reload the last savegame or restart the level.

Level Notes:
=============

This level is mostly complete, it just needs some minor work on the map layout, and definately a better end area (where the main outdoor water cave area is).

Monster placement I did sucks and should be redone, in addition to adding some triggers to open walls and have monsters spring out at the player (like in DOOM levels).

Also, I made some effort to break up the middle of the castle between the caves, left and right hand rooms, and the courtyard. Slower PCs will hurt in that area because of the amount of stuff that is visible.

Anyone can do anything with this level, just give me credit for the base of your efforts.

Enjoy!
