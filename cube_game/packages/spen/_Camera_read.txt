--INFOS------------------------------------------------------------

game: Cube (http://wouter.fov120.com/cube/  www.cubeengine.com)
format: single player
base: scratch (256^2 cubes)

-- INSTALLATION ---------------------------------------------------
Extract all files into the folder "packages" within your CUBE folder, with the
"use folder names" option checked. This will create the "spen" folder in "packages"
and place the map files in the "base" folder.

To play: Start Cube and open the console using tilde (~) key, leave the slash there. 
         Type   sp camera   and enter for normal difficulty.
         
-- STORY ---------------------------------------------------------
Say "Cheese"!

--MAP NOTES---------------------------------------------------
1. Jump pads are indicated by lighted squares. 
2. Do not activate edit mode when playing, gameplay will be ruined. If this
   accidently happens, restart the level or reload a saved game. If accidently
   hitting the edit key (normally E) is a problem, bind the key to another 
   function (example command:  bind e "weapon" ).
3. Exception to (2): press edit twice immediately after starting for easy mode
   (works properly with this level only, uneven).

--CUBE NOTES-------
F8=quicksave. F9=quickload. Cube's built-in skill settings may be altered in mid-level.

I may have seen the game not do a trigger properly. It is already a good idea to do 
savegames right before rather than right after taking a trigger or switch. If you get to the
end arena and have a problem, the trigger sequence (command trigger N) for the barriers is 9, 10, 12, 11.
 
--THANKS------------
Thanks to everyone involved for making Cube the Game it is. In addition this level was made 
possible by Aardappel, dcp and the other modellers, and the texture artists, and the music
of Fanatic adds the final touch. Testing: SirLiveAlot, jcdpc.
