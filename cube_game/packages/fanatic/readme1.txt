The Cube Album:
================

Written, recorded, mixed, and mastered by Marc A. Pullen (aka Fanatic) for the Cube game engine.

All 10 songs were written for a new release of the Cube engine, and were released on 5/2/2004. They were encoded as OGG format (http://www.vorbis.com) at 22khz and 56kbps for size considerations.

You can download the high quality MP3s (encoded at CD quality) here:

Any guitars you hear in the tracks were played via live guitar using a Line 6 PODxt preamp for bass, rhythm, and lead guitars. Drum kits are from a variety of sources, including the Meshuggah Drum Kit From Hell samples.

Guitars used: Gibson SG custom, Ibanez SA, and Ibanez SDGR 4 string bass

All recording and mixing was done with Record Producer (http://voyetra.com/site/products/rp/), and final mixdown and cleanup was done in Cool Edit 96.
