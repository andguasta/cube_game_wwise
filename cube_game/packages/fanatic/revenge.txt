=============
To Install:
=============

IMPORTANT!

Unzip this file to where you installed your Cube package into the "packages\" folder, extracting with directory structure.

This will place my revenge*.* files in the "packages\fanatic" folder, and some new models from dcp in "models\dcp".

See http://cube.dietmarpier.de/ for dcp's other awesome add-ons and replacements for Cube.

Also, you may want to tweak or remove some settings in the revenge.cfg if you are running a slow computer.

=============
To Play:
=============

Run cube, then in the game press the tilde key (~), and type:

/mode -2 (if you want to play this level as single player, otherwise just the next line if you want to look around)

/map fanatic\revenge

Level Notes:
=============

The level is something that I just felt like doing, more for a design fun than playing. I'm still quite impressed with how much you can make with Cube, and how fun and easy it is to edit.

I play tested this fairly lightly, so it will most likely be hard (if not very difficult/impossible) to finish. I ran fairly low on ammo and health in many places, but it was a good challenge.

The music is an original song I wrote, you can do anything with it for non-commercial and non-profit uses.

Enjoy!
