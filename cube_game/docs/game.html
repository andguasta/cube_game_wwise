								<td><font size="-1"><pre><font size=3>    map M     </font></pre>
										loads a map. if connected to a multiplayer server, votes to load this map 
										(others will have to&nbsp;type "map M" as well to agree with loading this 
										map).&nbsp;To vote for a map with a specific mode, set the mode before you 
										issue the map command (see multiplayer menu). See also map in the editref.
										<pre><font size=3>    name yourname     </font></pre>
										used for multiplayer
										<pre><font size=3>    say text...     </font></pre>
										outputs text to all players, as if you typed it
										<pre><font size=3>    echo text...     </font></pre>
										outputs text
										<pre><font size=3>    saycommand P...     </font></pre>
										this puts a prompt on screen where you can type stuff into, which will capture 
										all keystrokes until you press return (or esc to cancel). You may press tab to 
										autocomplete commands/aliases/variables, and up/down keys to browse the command 
										history. If what you typed started with a "/", the rest of it will be executed 
										as a command, otherwise its something you "say" to all players. default key = 
										t. If P is prefix to insert to the buffer, (default key ` inserts a /).
										<pre><font size=3>    connect serverip     </font></pre>
										connects to a server, e.g. "connect fov120.com". There is no serverbrowser nor 
										paste yet, so you are adviced to paste ips into a suitable bind into your 
										autoexec.cfg for the moment.
										<pre><font size=3>    disconnect     </font></pre>
										leaves server
										<pre><font size=3>    rate N     </font></pre>
										sets your clients maximum downstream bandwidth to N bytes per second. Leaving 
										it at 0 (the default) means the server will dynamically try to do the best 
										thing, this is recommended for players who don't have a clue what their 
										bandwidth is (setting your rate unoptimally is worse than not setting it all). 
										Modem players (56k)&nbsp;could try rate 4000 and tweak from there, dsl players 
										can try rate 6000-10000. Note that the more players on a server, the more 
										critical the effect of your rate. If you are tweak addicted, you can try 
										playing with the variables throttle_decel (how quickly to start dropping 
										packets when your connection becomes bandwidth limited) throttle_accel (how 
										quickly to recover once bandwidth becomes available again) and 
										throttle_interval (how quickly to reestimate the situation). Change the 
										defaults at your own risk.
										<pre><font size=3>    team teamname     </font></pre>
										determines who are your teammates in any team game mode (truncated to 4 
										characters, case sensitive).
										<pre><font size=3>    showscores     </font></pre>
										+showscores turns display of scores (name/frags/network) on and -showscores 
										turns it off. Default key = tab
										<pre><font size=3>    conskip N     </font></pre>
										allows you to browse through the console history, by offsetting the console 
										output by N. Default key keypad - scrolls into the history (conskip 1) and 
										keypad + resets the history (conskip -1000).
										<pre><font size=3>    weapon a b c     </font></pre>
										Tries to select weapons a, b &amp; c, in that order, if they have ammo (0 = 
										fist, 1 = sg, 2 = cg, 3 = rl, 4 = rifle). If none of the 3 indicated have any 
										ammo, it will try the remaining weapons for one with ammo (in order 3/2/1/4/0) 
										(the fist needs no ammo). You can use the weapon command with 0 to 3 arguments. 
										examples:
										<pre><font size=3>
    weapon 2 1 0     // close up selection
    weapon 4 3 2     // far away selection
    weapon 3 2 1     // medium distance selection
    weapon 0         // humiliate selection :)
    weapon           // just switch to anything with ammo
    </font></pre>
										In any selection, it will skip whichever weapon you have currently selected, so 
										executing a weapon command repeatedly toggles between the two best weapons with 
										ammo within a given selection. default keys 0 to 4 select the corresponding 
										weapons, with sensible default alternatives, middle mouse button is a simple 
										weapon switch.
										<pre><font size=3>    gamespeed P     </font></pre>
										sets the gamespeed in percent, i.e. 50 is playing in slowmotion at half the 
										speed. does not work in multiplayer. for entertainment purposes only :)
										<pre><font size=3>    mode N     </font></pre>
										set gameplay mode to N for the next game played (next map load). N can be:
										<UL>
											<LI>
											0: "ffa" / "default" mode. This is the default normal ffa game, and can also be 
											used as "prewar" while setting up teams / voting for the next game.&nbsp;
											<LI>
											1: coop edit mode. This simply enables map editing in multiplayer, otherwise 
											identical to mode 0.
											<LI>
											2: a standard non teamplay game, meant for FFA and duel games.
											<LI>
											3: a standard teamplay game. will work with any number of teams with any number 
											of players: you are allied with all players whose "team" setting is the same as 
											yours. In general, all odd numbered modes (3/5/7/9/11) are the teamplay variant 
											of the even mode preceding it
											<LI>
											4/5: instagib mode. No items will spawn, but everyone will have 100 rifle 
											rounds and 1 health. The fist still works.
											<LI>
											6/7: efficiency mode. No items will spawn, but everyone will get all weapons 
											with 2 ammo packs each, and 256 health on respawn.
											<LI>
											8/9: insta arena mode. As efficiency mode, but now when you die you stay dead 
											until one player or one team remains, then everyone respawns (new round). You 
											only get the rifle and the fist.
											<LI>
											10/11: tactics arena mode. As insta arena mode, but now you get randomly 2 out 
											of the 4 main weapons with 2 ammo packs each.
											<LI>
												-1, -2: single player, see single player mode section below.
											</LI>
										</UL>
										Frag counting is the same for all modes: 1 for a frag, -1 for a suicide or a 
										teamkill. Timelimit for all games is 10 minutes, or 15 minutes for teamplay, 
										and no timelimit for mode 1 (and mode 0 in a local game).
										<P><pre><font size=3>    skill N     </font></pre>
											Sets the skill level (1-10) for single player modes. Default = 3. Affects 
											number of monsters in DMSP mode, and general monster AI in all SP modes.
											<pre><font size=3>    sendmap     </font></pre>
											<pre><font size=3>    getmap     </font></pre>
											These two commands allow you to send other players maps they may not have while 
											in multiplayer mode, and easily keep maps in sync while doing coop edit. 
											"sendmap" reloads the current map you are on, then uploads it to the server and 
											sends every other player a message about it. Other players can then simply type 
											"getmap" to receive the current map, which is written to their local disk then 
											reloaded. A second variant "sendmap name" is available which is particularly 
											useful for coop editing, which first does a "savemap name" before performing 
											the actual "sendmap". Thus in both cases you must already be on the map you 
											want to send before issuing the command! (in some multiplayer that requires 
											voting). Also note that "getmap" operates on the last map send by some other 
											player, whatever it is.
											<pre><font size=3>    servermenu     </font></pre>
											displays the server menu. The server menu contains the last N servers you 
											connected to, sorted by ping (servers are pinged automatically when bringing up 
											this menu). Just select one to connect again. If you connect to a server by 
											typing "connect" manually, the server gets added here automatically. You can 
											also add servers to "servers.cfg" manually.
											<pre><font size=3>    updatefrommaster     </font></pre>
											contacts the masterserver and adds any new servers to the server list (written 
											to servers.cfg on exit). (see also multiplayer menu).
											<pre><font size=3>    savegame F     </font></pre>
											Saves the current state of game (map, state of entities, monsters, triggers, 
											and your player) to a savegame file named F (these are placed in the 
											"savegames" directory). Default key F8 is "savegame quicksave". Works only in 
											classic singleplayer mode.
											<pre><font size=3>    loadgame F     </font></pre>
											restores a previously saved game named F. Default key F9 is "loadgame 
											quicksave".&nbsp;You cannot load savegames from different versions of 
											the&nbsp;map, different versions&nbsp;of cube, or different cpu architectures.
											<pre><font size=3>    record N     </font></pre>
											Starts recording of a demo. This works for any multiplayer mode, including the 
											default "ffa" mode you are in when you load up a map locally. The file is saved 
											to demos/N.cdgz.
											<pre><font size=3>    stop     </font></pre>
											Stops any demo recording or playback.
											<pre><font size=3>    demo N     </font></pre>
											Plays back the demo recorded under name N. Playback is interpolated for the 
											player whose perspective you view (not changeable). Not all parts of the game 
											may work correctly under demo play, this is an experimental feature. If you 
											find anything not functioning that greatly hampers your enjoyment of watching 
											demos, let me know. See below for additional commands to use with demos.
											<pre><font size=3>    demoplaybackspeed P     </font></pre>
											Very experimental, may cause more problems than normal play. Set before playing 
											a demo, P is a percentage, i.e. 200 will play back at twice the speed.
											<pre><font size=3>    demodelaymsec D     </font></pre>
											Only touch if you know what you are doing: changes the delay in msec with which 
											the demo is played back to allow for interpolation. Default is 100, if you 
											decrease it you will most likely just get choppier (it will obstruct the spline 
											interpolation) for an unnoticable bit less lag. Increase it if you notice 
											choppyness in playback, should not be needed in general, but may help if you 
											insist on playing back demos at very low demoplaybackspeed.
											<pre><font size=3>    demotracking B     </font></pre>
											When demotracking is on (B = 1), the camera will create a red particle every 
											frame where it moves, creating a trail. This can be used to inspect someone's 
											movement in a game. It will only show the last N particles according to the 
											maxparticles variable, which you may want to increase to 10000. The particles 
											will remain even after you stop the demo, so you can use edit mode to look at 
											it from all angles.
											<pre><font size=3>    password P     </font></pre>
										Set the password to P, so you can join servers that are password protected. See 
										the -p command line option.

								Start cube

								go to the multiplayer menu and select "update from master server", this will 
								get you the lastest server list (you only need to do this once every day of 
								multiplayer gaming or so).
								<li>
								select the server browser in the multiplayer menu. see how all servers get

								<li>
								select a server with a good ping (near the top of the list, below 200 is very

								run, shoot and enjoy!
								<li>
									you may want to get familiar with the various game modes cube has, and how to

							Setting up a LAN game:
							<ul>
								<li>
								One of the computers on the LAN has to run server.bat. It really doesn't matter

								servername is the network name or ip address of the machine running server.bat. 
								if all went well you should now be in the game together, as above.

									If your LAN is connected to the internet, by default your server will register 
									with the masterserver, and players could thus follow the procedure above to 
									join the game: your server will show up in the list, and may thus be joined by

							The models are just temp until I find some real monster models.
							<p>
							The damage given is for a single shot, where damage is simply a quarter of the 
							equivalent player gun. For the shotgun this is if he hits you at point blank 
							range, but is a lot less at distance. RL guy of course deals out splash damage 
							too.
							<p>
							Stamina is the amount of damage taken before dying, speed is their movement 
							speed in cubes/sec (player = 24), and freq is their relative frequency of 
							spawning in DMSP mode.
							<p>
							<p>
							"lag" is how long it takes them to press fire after they have decided they will 
							shoot in a particular direction, which means you can out-strafe their bullets 
							(but still get hit when standing still or moving towards them). The number is 
							in msec on skill 0, and half as big on skill 10.
							<P>
							"rate" indicates how often they will attempt to shoot you while they have you 
							in their sights. It is not an absolute fire rate measure, as fire rate is lower 
							with distance and has some absolute minimum. Again, it is also dependant on 
							skill (skill 10 fires twice as often as skill 0). "loyalty" indicates how often 
							they have to be hit by another monster in a row before they fight back.
							<P>
							Other important parameters: monsters will at most jump down 4 cubes in height, 
							unless their health is 100 or less, in which case they allways jump down.
							<P>
							As you can summise from the above, the keys to surviving in cube SP are: keep 
							moving, preferably perpendicular to the monster line of sight, 
							frequently&nbsp;move behind&nbsp;walls and back&nbsp;(this makes monsters 
							search for you again, which delays them), and use monster infighting to your 
							advantage.

							than most games out there. The reason for this is that just about everything in 
							cube is done clientside, not just movement (as is common in games today) but 
							also aim (the fat client / thin server model).
							<p>
							The benefits of this are that the effects of lag are minimised, and someone on 
							a 200 ping can compete on an almost even playing field with someone with a 20 
							ping, the disadvantages are mainly in that its harder to combat cheating. 
							Further advantages for server admins are that cube servers use virtually no 
							cpu, and very little bandwidth for a lot of clients (you can host a 4 player 
							game on a modem!).
							<p>It is impossible to completely hide lag however, and these are some of the 
								effects that can still show lag if you or someone you play with has a high ping 
								/ bad connection:
								<ul>
									<li>
										if the connection has packetloss. There is no direct indicator of packetloss, 
										instead the "packet jump" figure is provided on the hud (use "showscores"). 
										Packet jump says as much as the amount of milliseconds that pass between 
										updates from the indicated player. If it is extremely variable, or is 
										high(&gt;80) then your gameplay may be hampered (players jumping from place to 
										place). Ideally it is a steady 40 or lower. A consistent packet jump is more 
										vital to gameplay than ping.
										<p>
										Cube uses player prediction based on extrapolation using the physics model, in 
										an attempt to be both as up to date as possible w.r.t. to the game state, and 
										as realistic w.r.t. to physics. However, under packet loss this model breaks 
										down and player movement becomes choppy.
										<p></p>
									<li>
										if ping is high (either yours or someone you play with), some actions may 
										appear lagged. The effect of ping is generally that the players in a game are 
										effectively playing more and more seperate games, as someone with a high ping 
										is "playing in the past". The local effects of this are masked out by client 
										side movement &amp; aim, but may become noticable across players:
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													you may get hit by someone even though you are already out of his view. This is 
													because he is aiming at your movements of a while ago, and his hits take a 
													while to arrive back at you. You may therefore be hit by gunfire up to his lag 
													+ your lag milliseconds after you leave his FOV.
													<p></p>
												<li>
													item pickup: you may be denied an item if you try to pick it up at virtually 
													the same time as someone else (server decides who was "first"). Item pickup is 
													server side, only when you hear the sound effect have you actually picked up 
													the item.
													<p></p>
												<li>
													players dying appears lagged. This will improve.</li>
											</ul>
										<p></p>
									<li>
										if a player is severely lagged (or you are) he temporarily becomes a "ghost" 
										that cannot be hit (if &gt;1sec packet jump).</li></ul>
