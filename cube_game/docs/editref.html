										<pre><font size=3>    edittoggle     </font></pre>
										switches between map edit mode and normal (default key = e). In map edit mode 
										you can select bits of the map by clicking or dragging your crosshair on the 
										floor or ceiling (using the "attack" command, normally MOUSE1), then use the 
										commands below to modify the selection. While in edit mode, physics &amp; 
										collision don't apply (noclip), and key repeat is ON. Note that if you fly 
										outside the map, cube still renders the world as if you were standing on the 
										floor directly below the camera.
										<pre><font size=3>    edittex T D     </font></pre>
										Changes the texture on current selection by browsing through a list of textures 
										directly shown on the cubes. T is an integer denoting the type (floor = 0, 
										lower or wall = 1, ceiling = 2, upper wall = 3), D is the direction you want to 
										cycle the textures in (1 = forwards, -1 = backwards). Default keys are the six 
										keys above the cursor keys, which each 2 of them cycle one type (and numpad 7/4 
										for upper).
										<p>
											The way this works is slightly strange at first, but allows for very fast 
											texture assignment. All textures are in 3 individual lists for each type (both 
											wall kinds treated the same), and each time a texture is used, it is moved to 
											the top of the list. So after a bit of editing, all your most frequently used 
											textures will come first when pressing these keys, and the most recently used 
											texture is set immediately when you press the forward key for the type. These 
											lists are saved with the map. make a selection (including wall bits) and press 
											these keys to get a feel for what they do.
											<pre><font size=3>    editheight T D     </font></pre>
											T is the type as above (floors &amp; ceilings only), and D is the delta value 
											to move it in. Default keys are [ and ] for floor level, and o/p for ceiling.
											<pre><font size=3>    solid B     </font></pre>
											makes the current selection all solid (i.e. wall) if B is true (non-zero), or 
											all non-solid if it is false (0). This operation retains floor/ceiling 
											heights/textures while swapping between the two. Default keys f and g 
											respectively.
											<pre><font size=3>    equalize T     </font></pre>
											levels the floor/ceiling of the selection (T as above). default keys , and .
											<pre><font size=3>    heightfield T     </font></pre>
										marks the current selection as a heightfield, with T being floor or ceiling, as 
										above. A surface marked as heightfield will use the vdelta values (see below) 
										of its 4 corners to create a sloped surface. To mark a heightfield as normal 
										again (ignoring vdelta values, set or not) use "solid 0". Default keys are h 
										(floor) and i (ceiling).
										<p>
											Heightfields should be made the exact size that is needed, not more not less. 
											The most important reason for this is that cube automatically generates "caps" 
											(side-faces for heightfields) only on the borders of the heighfield. This also 
											means if you have 2 independant heightfields accidentally touch eachother, you 
											will not get correct caps. Also, a heighfield is slightly slower to render than 
											a non-heighfield floor or ceiling. Last but not least, a heightfield should 
											have all the same baseheight (i.e. the height determined by a normal editheight 
											operation) to get correct results.
											<pre><font size=3>    vdelta N     </font></pre>
										changes the vdelta value of the current selection by N. Note that unlike all 
										other editing functions, this function doesn't affect a cube, but its top-left 
										vertex (market by the dot in the editing cursor). So to edit a N * M 
										heightfield, you will likely have to edit the vdelta of (N+1) * (M+1) cubes, 
										i.e. you have to select 1 row and 1 column more in the opposite direction of 
										the red dot to affect all the vertices of a heightfield of a given size (try 
										it, it makes sense :)
										<p>
											A floor delta offsets vertices to beneath the level set by editheight (and a 
											ceil delta to above). Delta offsets have a precision of a quarter of a unit, 
											however you should use non-unitsize vertices only to touch other such vertices. 
											Default keys are 8 and 9 to decrease/increase the vdelta.
											<pre><font size=3>    corner     </font></pre>
											makes the current selection into a "corner". Currently there is only one type 
											of corner (a 45 degree one), only works on a single unit (cube) at a time. It 
											can be positioned:
											<lu>
    <li> next to 2 solid walls
    <li>
													in the middle of 2 higher floorlevels and 2 lower ones forming a diagonal (and 
													similar with ceiling)
													<UL>
													</UL>
													In both cases, the corner will orient itself automatically depending on its 
													neighbours, behaviour with other configurations than the 2 above is 
													unspecified. Since the latter configuration generates possibly 2 floor and 2 
													ceiling levels, up to 4 textures are used: for example for the 2 floors the 
													higher one will of the cube itself, and the lower one of a neighbouring low 
													cube. Default key = k you can make bigger corners at once by pressing "corner" 
													on grid aligned 2x2/4x4/8x8 selections, with equal size solid blocks next to 
													them.
													<pre><font size=3>    undo     </font></pre>
													multi-level undo of any of the changes caused by the above operations (default 
													key = u).
													<pre><font size=3>    undomegs N     </font></pre>
													sets the number of megabytes used for the undo buffer (default 1). undo's work 
													for any size areas, so the amount of undo steps per megabyte is more for small 
													areas than for big ones (a megabyte fits 280 undo steps on a 16x16 area, but 
													only 4 steps on a 128x128 area).
													<pre><font size=3>    copy     </font></pre>
													<pre><font size=3>    paste     </font></pre>
													copy copies the current selection into a buffer. to paste it back requires a 
													same size selection at the destination location. If it is not the same size the 
													selection will be resized automatically prior to the paste operation (with the 
													red dot as anchor), which is easier for large selections. (default keys are c 
													and v respectively).
													<pre><font size=3>    replace     </font></pre>
													repeats your last texture edit thruout the map. The way it works is intuitive: 
													simply edit any texture anywhere, then using "replace" will replace all 
													textures thruout the map in the same way (taking into account wether it was a 
													floor/wall/ceil/upper too). if the there was more than one "old" texture in 
													your selection, the one nearest to the red dot is used. This operation can't be 
													undone.
													<pre><font size=3>    newent type    value1 value2 value3 value4     </font></pre>
													adds a new entity where (x,y) is determined by the current selection (the red 
													dot corner) and z by the camera height, of said type. Type is a string giving 
													the type of entity, such as "light", and may optionally take values (depending 
													on the entity):
													<ul>
														<li>
															<pre><font size=3>"light" radius brightness
"light" radius r g b    </font></pre>
															radius in units (1..32), optionally brightness (1..255) for a white light, or 
															coloured light (each component 1..255). Default key l creates a new light 
															(cylindrical) of radius 16, brightness 255 (white).
															<p></p>
														<li>
															<pre><font size=3>"playerstart"    </font></pre>
															Spawn spot, yaw is taken from the current camera yaw.
															<p></p>
														<li>
															<pre><font size=3>"shells", "bullets", "rockets", "riflerounds", "health",
"healthboost", "greenarmour", "yellowarmour", "quaddamage"    </font></pre>
															A variety of pickup-able items, see <a href="game.html">here</a>.
															<p>
															</p>
														<li>
															<pre><font size=3>"teleport" N
"teledest" N    </font></pre>
															creates a teleport connection, teleports are linked to a teledest with the same 
															N (of which there should be exactly one). N can be 0..255. The teledest uses 
															the current camera yaw.
															<P></P>
														<li>
															<pre><font size=3>"mapmodel" N Z T   </font></pre>
															A map model, i.e. an object rendered as md2 which you collide against but has 
															no behaviour/movement. N determines which mapmodel you want, which is defined 
															by the "mapmodel" command, see below. yaw of the model is taken from the 
															current camera yaw (snapped to 15 degree increments). Z determines extra 
															elevation above the default (usually the ground). T is the map texture to use 
															(see data/default_map_settings.cfg for the number), if left as 0 then the 
															skin.jpg in the model directory is used (if present). Mapmodels are more 
															expensive than normal map geometry, do not use insane amounts of them to 
															replace normal geometry.
															<p></p>
														<li>
															<pre><font size=3>"monster" N   </font></pre>
															A monster, currently N = 0..4 (see gameplay docs). Monster entities will be 
															spawned when in classic single player mode, and will attack you when you come 
															into view. yaw is taken from the current camera yaw.
															<p></p>
														<li>
															<pre><font size=3>"trigger" N T O  </font></pre>
															A trigger of type T affecting all cubes with tag N when triggered in game (see 
															"edittag" on how to set tags on cubes). Triggers are rendered as a carrot 
															which, when "eaten", trigger an event (only once). The following trigger types 
															are available:
															<p>
															0: On being triggered, sets all target cubes to SPACE. This has the effect of 
															instantly opening doors or other geometry. You edit these "doors" as SPACE, 
															i.e. you determine what the "door" looks like when opened, they are then set to 
															SOLID automatically when playing (map start / edit toggle). Current "doors" 
															open instantly. "rumble" sound alerts the player something has opened.
															<p>
															1: invisible: same as 0 but without the carrot. since the trigger radius is 
															fairly small, be sure to place them in tiny hallways and other areas you are 
															sure the player will pass through.
															<p>
																2: end of map marker. ends the map and triggers the intermission. carrot spins 
																wildly.
																<BR>
																<BR>
																3: same as 1, but makes no rumble sound.<BR>
																<BR>
																4: same as 0, but with switch model instead of carrot (O is orientation, 0..3)<BR>
																5: same as 0, but with&nbsp;lever model instead of carrot (O is orientation, 
																0..3)<BR>
															</p>
														<LI>
															<p>
															Scripting: each trigger automatically executes the alias "level_trigger_N" 
															where N is the trigger number. This means you can add any scripting you can do 
															through the available commands, by simply putting aliases of this kind in the 
															level .cfg file. For example, to print a message when the user hits trigger 1:
															<p>
															alias level_trigger_1 "echo A door opened nearby"
															<p></p>
														<li>
															<pre><font size=3>"jumppad" Z Y X  </font></pre>
															A jumppad entity which gives you a physics push in the direction specified. For 
															example "jumppad 30 5" makes you bounce up quite a bit and also pushes you 
															forward a bit (so it is easier to land on a higher platform). This entity does 
															not render anything, you are responsible for creating something that looks 
															logical below this entity :)
															<p></p>
														</li>
													</ul>
													Entities are shown in editmode by blue sparklies, and the closest one is 
													indicated on the HUD.
													<pre><font size=3>    delent     </font></pre>
													deletes the entity closest to the player (default key x)
													<pre><font size=3>    entproperty P A     </font></pre>
													changes property P (0..3) of the closest entity by amount A. For example 
													"entproperty 0 2" when executed near a lightsource would increase its radius by 
													2.
													<pre><font size=3>    clearents type     </font></pre>
													deletes all entities of said type.
													<pre><font size=3>    recalc     </font></pre>
													recomputes all there is to recompute about a map, currently only lighting. 
													Default key = r
													<pre><font size=3>    map name     </font></pre>
													loads up map "name" in the gamemode set previously by "mode". A map given as 
													"blah" refers to "packages/base/blah.cgz", "mypackage/blah" refers to 
													"packages/mypackage/blah.cgz". The menu has a set of maps that can be loaded. 
													See also map in the gameplay docs.
													<p>
													At every map load, "data/default_map_settings.cfg" is loaded which sets up all 
													texture definitions etc. Everything defined in there can be overridden per 
													package or per map by creating a "package.cfg" or "mapname.cfg" which contains 
													whatever you want to do differently from the default. It can also set up 
													triggers scripts per map etc.
													<p>
														When the map finishes it will load the next map when one is defined, otherwise 
														reloads the current map. You can define what map follows a particular map by 
														making an alias like (in the map script): <code><font size="2">alias nextmap_blah1 
																blah2</font></code> (loads "blah2" after "blah1").
														<pre><font size=3>    savemap name     </font></pre>
													saves the current map, using the same naming scheme as "map". makes a versioned 
													backup (mapname_N.BAK) if a map by that name already exists, so you can never 
													lose a map. If you leave out the "name" argument, it is saved under the current 
													map name.
													<p>
														where you store a map depends on the complexity of what you are creating: if 
														its a single map (maybe with its own .cfg) then the "base" package is the best 
														place. If its multiple maps or a map with new media (textures etc.) its better 
														to store it in its own package (a directory under "packages"), which makes 
														distributing it less messy.
														<pre><font size=3>    newmap size     </font></pre>
														creates a new map of 2^size cubes. 6 is small, 7 medium, 8 large. You can go up 
														to 12 but theres not a lot of point in that :)
														<pre><font size=3>    mapenlarge     </font></pre>
														if you accidentally made your map too small, this command will make it 1 power 
														of two bigger. So if you created a 6 size map (64x64 units) it will become a 7 
														map (128x128), with your old map in the middle (from 32-96) and the new areas 
														solid.
														<pre><font size=3>    mapmsg "Title by Author"     </font></pre>
														sets the map msg, which will be displayed when the map loads. Either use the 
														above format, or simply "by Author" if the map has no particular title (always 
														displayed after the map load msg).
														<pre><font size=3>    waterlevel H     </font></pre>
														sets the global water level in your map to H (an empty map has levels 0-16), 
														which will render every cube that has a lower floor than H with a nice wavy 
														water alpha texture, and applies water physics to any entity located below it. 
														Performance notes: water is rendered for a whole square encapsulating all 
														visible water areas in the map (try flying above the map in edit mode to see 
														how). So the most efficient water is a single body of water, or multiple water 
														areas that are mostly not visible from eachother. Players can influence how 
														accurate the water is rendered using the "watersubdiv" command (config).
														<pre><font size=3>    fullbright    B     </font></pre>
														sets all light values to fullbright (1 = on, 0 = off), so you don't need to 
														edit the map in the dark. Will be reset when you issue a recalc. Only works in 
														edit mode.
														<pre><font size=3>    showmip     </font></pre>
														Toggles between showing what parts of the scenery are rendered using what size 
														cubes, and outputs some stats too. This can give mappers hints as to what 
														architecture to align / textures to change etc.
														<pre><font size=3>    toggleocull     </font></pre>
														turns occlusion culling on &amp; off. the reason you may want to turn it off is 
														to get an overview of your map from above, without having all occluded bits 
														stripped out.
														<pre><font size=3>    texturereset     </font></pre>
														sets the texture slot to 0 for the subsequent "texture" commands
														<pre><font size=3>    texture subnum filename     </font></pre>
														binds the texture indicated in filename to the current texture slot, then 
														increments the slot number. This is for use in texture.cfg files only. subnum 
														allows secondary textures to be specified for a single texture slot, for use in 
														shaders and other features (unused for now, should be set to 0 to indicate 
														primary texture).
														<pre><font size=3>    slope xdelta ydelta     </font></pre>
														makes a slope out of the current selection (make it a heighfield first). xdelta 
														and ydelta are the steps that specify the slope with the red vertex as 
														left-top, i.e. "slope 1 2" will make a slope that increases just 1 step from 
														left to right, and is slightly steeper from top to bottom. "slope -6 0" 
														decreases steeply from left to right, and does not slope at all from top to 
														bottom. Note that like the vdelta command, an increasing vdelta goes further 
														away from the player, regardless of floor or ceiling.
														<pre><font size=3>    arch sidedelta     </font></pre>
														makes an arch out of the current selection (first make it a heightfield of some 
														sort). Will make the arch in the long direction, i.e when you have 6x2 cubes 
														selected, the arch will span 7 vertices. optionally, sidedelta specifies the 
														delta to add to the outer rows of vertices in the other direction, i.e. give 
														the impression of an arch that bends 2 ways (try "arch 2" on an selection of 
														atleast 2 thick to see the effect). Not all arch sizes are necessarily 
														available, see data/prefabs.cfg.
														<pre><font size=3>    archvertex span vertex delta     </font></pre>
														defines a vertex delta for a specific arch span prefab, used by the "arch" 
														command. See data/prefabs.cfg for an example on usage.
														<pre><font size=3>    perlin scale seed cubesize     </font></pre>
														generates a perlin noise landscape in the current selection. scale determines 
														the frequency of the features, default = 10. seed sets the random seed, keep 
														this the same if you want to create multiple perlin areas which fit with 
														eachother, or use different numbers if you want alternative random generations. 
														cubesize says how many cubes to generate a surface for at once, not used for 
														now.
														<pre><font size=3>    select x y xs ys     </font></pre>
														selects the given area, as if dragged with the mouse. Useful for making complex 
														geometry-generating scripts. The current dimensions of the selection (either 
														created by the user or this command) are in the variables selx, sely, selxs and 
														selys and can also be read/modified. Coordinates are as follows: after a 
														"newmap 6" the top-left corner (the one where the red dot points) are (8,8), 
														the opposite corner is (56,56) (or (120,120) on a "newmap 7" etc.).
														<pre><font size=3>    edittag N     </font></pre>
														sets the tag value (1..255) for the current selection (0 means no tag). Tags 
														are used to determine what cubes to modify when a certain tag is triggered (see 
														"newent trigger"). If a cube has a tag associated with it, gridlines show up in 
														red.
														<pre><font size=3>    trigger N T    </font></pre>
														triggers trigger N of type T, as if the player had picked up the equivalent 
														"trigger" entity (see above).
														<pre><font size=3>    music name      </font></pre>
														plays song "name" (with "packages" as base dir). This command is best used from 
														map cfg files or triggers.
														<pre><font size=3>    N = registersound name      </font></pre>
														registers sound "name" with cube (see for example data/sounds.cfg). This 
														command returns the sound number N, which is assigned from 0 onwards, and which 
														can be used with "sound" command below. if the sound was already registered, 
														its existing index is returned. registersound does not actually load the sound, 
														this is done on first play.
														<pre><font size=3>    sound N      </font></pre>
														plays sound N, see data/sounds.cfg for default sounds, and use registersound to 
														register your own. for example, <code><font size="2">sound 0</font></code> and <code>
															<font size="2">sound (registersound "aard/jump")</font></code> both play 
														the standard jump sound.
														<pre><font size=3>    mapmodelreset     </font></pre>
														resets the mapmodel slots/indices to 0. Each subsequent mapmodel command 
														increases it again. see default_map_settings.cfg for an example
														<pre><font size=3>    mapmodel R H Z S N     </font></pre>
														registers a mapmodel that can be placed in maps using <code><font size="2">newent 
																mapmodel</font></code> (see newent). N is the name, R is the square 
														radius, H the height, Z the initial Z-offset above ground, and S the snap value 
														in 16ths of a cube unit (0 meaning no snap). All of these values are used for 
														collision as well as rendering. Specifying a snap can be useful for 
														architectural mapmodels, as the md2 format doesn't provide exact vertex 
														coordinates. Example: <code><font size="2">mapmodel 4 2 4 2</font></code> this 
														map model is 8x8x2 in size (x,y,z), by default hovers 4 units above ground, and 
														has all coordinates snapped to the nearest even number. See data/models.cfg.
														<pre><font size=3>    scalelights RP IP      </font></pre>
													Scales all lights in the map. Radius is scaled by perceptage RP and intensity 
													by IP. Useful if you have a map which is too dark or bright but you want to 
													keep the light entities where they are.
